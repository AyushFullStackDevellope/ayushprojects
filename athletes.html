                    is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen <br />in the history of cricket, and the best of
                    21st century. He is the highest run scorer in T20I and IPL. In 2020, the International Cricket

                </li>
                <br />

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni"><img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/04/10/550x309/ANI-20230408340-0_1681122393911_1681122393911_1681122413210_1681122413210.jpg"

                <br />
                <p>Dhoni plays for Chennai Super Kings in the IPL, leading them to the final on ten occasions and
                    winning it five times (2010, 2011, 2018, 2021 and 2023).<br /> He has also led CSK to two Champions
                    League T20 titles in 2010 and 2014. He is amongst the few batsmen to have scored more than five
                    thousand runs <br />in the IPL, as well as being the first wicket-keeper to do so.

                    In 2008, Dhoni was awarded India's highest sport honor Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award by
                    Government of India.Dhoni was born on 7 July 1981 in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) in a Hindu
                    Rajput family to Pan Singh and Devaki Devi. [3] His parents hailed from Lwali village in Uttar
                    Pradesh (now Uttarakhand) and he was the youngest of three children.[4][5][6] His family spells the
                    surname as "Dhauni".[7]

                    Dhoni did his schooling at DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir where he started playing football as a goal
                    keeper but later moved to play cricket on the suggestion of his coach Keshav Banerjee</p>

                <p> Abraham Benjamin de Villiers (born 17 February 1984) is a South African former international
                    cricketer, and a current commentator. AB de Villiers was named as the ICC ODI Player of the Year
                    three times during his 15-year international career and was one of the five Wisden cricketers of the
                    decade at the end of 2019.[2] He is regarded as one of the greatest cricketers in the history of the
                    sport and as the best batsman of his era.[3][4] de Villiers began his international career as a
                    wicket-keeper-batsman, but he has played most often solely as a batsman. He batted at various
                    positions in the batting order, but predominantly in the middle-order. Regarded as one of the most
                    innovative and destructive batsmen in the modern era, de Villiers is known for a range of unorthodox
                    shots, particularly behind the wicket-keeper.[5] He made his international debut in a Test match
                    against England in 2004 and first played a One Day International (ODI) in early 2005. His debut in
                    Twenty20 International cricket came in 2006. He scored over 8,000 runs in both Test and ODI cricket
                    and is one of the very few batsmen to have a batting average of over fifty in both forms of the
                    game.[6] In limited overs cricket, he is an attacking player.[7] He holds the record for the fastest
                    ODI fifty(16 balls), fastest ODI century(31 balls), and fastest ODI 150(62 balls)</p>

                <p>Glenn James Maxwell (born 14 October 1988) is an Australian professional cricketer. He has played for
                    the Australia national cricket team in all formats of the game since 2012, although he is primarily
                    a One Day International and Twenty20 International specialist.[3] Maxwell is an all-rounder who is
                    known for his sometimes unorthodox batting and bowls right arm off-break deliveries. Domestically he
                    played for Victoria and Melbourne Stars.[4] He was part of the Australian squads that won the 2015
                    Cricket World Cup, the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup, and the 2021 T20 World Cup. His ability to make
                    unconventional shots like reverse sweeps and pulls often makes it hard to set fields that cover all
                    of his scoring areas.[5]

                    Maxwell made his professional debut in 2010. Known for his dramatic shot making and improvisation in
                    short forms of the game,[6] in 2011, he set a new record for the fastest ever half-century in
                    Australian domestic one day cricket, scoring 50 runs from 19 balls</p>
