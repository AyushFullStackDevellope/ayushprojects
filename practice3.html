                    content. According to ThePrint, Rathee was one of the first Indian users to use YouTube as a
                    political platform, having started uploading travel videos in 2013 but by the end of 2013 he started

                    anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the
                    successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil
                    rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit 'great-souled,
                    venerable'), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world.

                    Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple,
                    London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where
